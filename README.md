I have used 3 classifying techniques for this project
1. Naive Bayes:Based on Bayes' theorem, the naive bayes algorithm is a straightforward and effective classification technique. It is frequently utilized in machine learning applications for text classification. The assumption that all features are independent of one another, which may not always be the case in real-world circumstances, is what gives the algorithm its "naive" label. 
2. Decision Tree:A supervised learning method called a decision tree can be used to solve classification and regression problems, but it is typically favored for doing so. It is a tree-structured classifier, where internal nodes stand in for a dataset's features, branches for the decision-making process, and each leaf node for the classification result.
3. Logistic Regression:The logistic regression statistic modeling technique is used when we have a binary outcome variable. For example: given the parameters, will the student pass or fail?. So, in this project I have predicted the subreddit category whether it belongs to machine learning, artificial intelligence or data science.
